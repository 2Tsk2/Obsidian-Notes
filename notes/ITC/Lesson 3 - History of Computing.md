### **Earliest Computing Devices**

1. **Abacus (18th Century, China)**
    
    - An early tool used for arithmetic calculations, consisting of beads on wires or rods.
    - Used by manipulating beads to perform basic mathematical functions.
2. **Napier’s Logs and Bones (17th Century, Europe)**
    
    - Invented by John Napier.
    - A simple device for multiplication using logarithms.
3. **Oughtred’s Slide Rule (17th Century, Europe)**
    
    - Invented by William Oughtred.
    - Consists of two movable rulers used to perform multiplication and division through logarithmic scales.
4. **Leibniz Calculator (1642, France)**
    
    - Invented by Wilhelm von Leibniz.
    - Capable of performing addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
5. **Punch Card Machine (1896, America)**
    
    - Developed by Herman Hollerith.
    - Automatically reads information punched into cards, without human intervention.
6. **Automatic Calculating Machine (1897, America)**
    
    - Created by Howard Aiken.
    - Could handle 23 decimal places and perform all arithmetic operations, with built-in subroutines for logarithms and trigonometric functions.
7. **Difference and Analytical Engine (19th Century, England)**
    
    - Designed by Charles Babbage.
    - Used for calculating and printing mathematical tables.
8. **Differential Analyzer (1930, America)**
    
    - Developed by Dr. Vannevar Bush.
    - Used for calculating artillery trajectories during WWII.
9. **ENIAC (1943-1946, America)**
    
    - One of the earliest electronic general-purpose computers, designed to perform a range of tasks using reprogrammable plugboards.


### **Key Figures in Computing History**

1. **Charles Babbage**
    - Known as the **Father of the Computer**.
    - Designed the first mechanical computer, the **Analytical Engine**, which laid the groundwork for modern computing.
2. **Ada Lovelace** 
    - The world’s first computer programmer.
    - Wrote the first algorithm intended for implementation on the Analytical Engine.
    
3. **Alan Turing** 
    - Pioneer of **modern computing** and artificial intelligence.
    - Developed the concept of the **Turing Machine**, an abstract machine that manipulates symbols to perform computation, which became the foundation of computer science.

4. **John von Neumann**
    - Developed the **von Neumann architecture**, which is the basis for most modern computers.
    - Introduced the concept of storing programs in a computer’s memory.
    
5. **Herman Hollerith**
    - Invented the **punch card system**, a method of inputting data into early computers, widely used in the 1890 U.S. Census.

### **First Generation Computers (1946-1959)**

1. **ENIAC (Electronic Numerical Integrator and Computer)**
    
    - **Description**: The first large-scale, fully electronic general-purpose computer. It used **vacuum tubes** to perform computations. ENIAC was programmable and capable of solving a variety of complex calculations, such as artillery trajectory tables for the U.S. Army.
    - **Features**: Weighed about 30 tons, used 18,000 vacuum tubes, and consumed massive amounts of power. It could perform 5,000 additions per second.
2. **EDVAC (Electronic Discrete Variable Automatic Computer)**
    
    - **Description**: An improvement on the ENIAC, EDVAC was designed to use the **stored-program concept** proposed by John von Neumann, which allowed both data and instructions to be stored in memory.
    - **Features**: Reduced the amount of reprogramming time needed compared to ENIAC, and was more efficient in handling instructions.

### **Second Generation Computers (1959-1965)**

1. **IBM 1401**
    - **Description**: One of the most popular second-generation computers, it used **transistors** instead of vacuum tubes, which made it smaller, faster, and more reliable.
    - **Features**: It was a general-purpose computer used mainly for business and administrative purposes. It supported **assembly language** for programming and was widely used in data processing.

### **Third Generation Computers (1965-1971)**

1. **IBM System/360**
    - **Description**: A family of **mainframe computers** designed by IBM, this system was notable for its ability to run different applications and workloads on a single architecture. It used **integrated circuits (ICs)** for increased efficiency and performance.
    - **Features**: Allowed for standardization across many industries because its hardware and software were compatible across different models. It was used in both scientific and business environments.

### **Fourth Generation Computers (1971-1980)**

1. **Apple II**
    
    - **Description**: One of the first highly successful personal computers, the **Apple II** was designed for use by individuals and small businesses. It featured **microprocessors**, making it compact and affordable.
    - **Features**: It came with a built-in keyboard, a monitor output, and support for external storage (floppy disks). It was widely used in education and business.
2. **IBM PC (Personal Computer)**
    
    - **Description**: IBMâ€™s first attempt at entering the personal computer market. The IBM PC became a standard for personal computers, using an **Intel 8088 microprocessor** and allowing for compatibility with various software and peripherals.
    - **Features**: It used a simple architecture, allowing third-party developers to create compatible hardware and software, leading to widespread use in homes and businesses.

### **Fifth Generation Computers (1980-present)**

1. **Deep Blue**
    
    - **Description**: An AI-powered supercomputer developed by IBM, best known for defeating world chess champion Garry Kasparov in 1997. It used **parallel processing** to evaluate thousands of chess positions per second.
    - **Features**: It was capable of evaluating 200 million chess positions per second, using a combination of AI and brute-force computing to anticipate and counter its opponent's moves.
2. **AlphaGo**
    
    - **Description**: Developed by Google DeepMind, **AlphaGo** is an AI program designed to play the game of Go. It became the first AI to defeat a professional human Go player and later the world champion.
    - **Features**: AlphaGo used a **deep learning neural network** that allowed it to learn from previous games and improve its gameplay over time. It demonstrated significant advancements in AI and machine learning.

1. **Data Processing Cycle**  
   - **Input**: Collects raw data from various sources (e.g., keyboard, mouse, scanner).  
     - Example: Typing text into a word processor.
   - **Processing**: CPU processes the input data, converting it into meaningful information.  
     - Example: CPU performing calculations or running applications.
   - **Output**: Displays or outputs the processed data (e.g., monitor, printer).  
     - Example: Displaying a document on the screen.
   - **Storage**: Saves data for future access (e.g., hard drives, SSDs).  
     - Example: Saving a file on a hard drive.

2. **Hardware**  
   - **Definition**: Physical components of a computer system.
   - **Examples**:
     - **CPU (Central Processing Unit)**: The brain of the computer; executes instructions.
     - **RAM (Random Access Memory)**: Temporary memory used for running programs.
     - **Hard Drive (HDD/SSD)**: Permanent storage for data and applications.
     - **Input Devices**: Keyboard, mouse, scanner.
     - **Output Devices**: Monitor, printer, speakers.
     - **Motherboard**: Main circuit board connecting all hardware components.
   - **Evolution**: From **vacuum tubes** to **transistors** to **integrated circuits (ICs)**, leading to **modern microchips**.

3. **Software**  
   - **Definition**: Programs and instructions that run on hardware.
   - **Types**:
     - **System Software**: Operating systems (e.g., Windows, Linux) that manage hardware and software resources.
     - **Application Software**: Programs designed for end-users (e.g., Microsoft Word, Photoshop).
   - **Role**: Software enables the hardware to perform tasks. Without software, hardware is inert.

4. **Peopleware**  
   - **Definition**: The people involved in the computing process, from development to operation.
   - **Examples**:
     - **Programmers**: Write the code for software applications.
     - **System Administrators**: Manage and maintain computer systems.
     - **End-users**: People who use the software and hardware for tasks.

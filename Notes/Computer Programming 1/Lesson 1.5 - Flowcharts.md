### **Flowchart**
A **flowchart** is a graphical representation of an algorithm, showing the flow of control in a process using specific symbols. Here are the key **flowchart symbols**:

### **Flowchart Symbols**
- **Oval (Start/Stop)**
    - **Description**: Indicates the start or end of a process.
    - **Example**: Start, Stop.
    
- **Parallelogram (Input/Output)**
    - **Description**: Represents input or output operations, such as entering data or displaying results.
    - **Example**: Input A, B, C; Output P.

- **Rectangle (Process)**
    - **Description**: Represents a processing step, such as performing calculations or assignments.
    - **Example**: P = A * B * C.
    
- **Diamond (Decision)**
    - **Description**: Used for decision points where conditions are checked, leading to different paths.
    - **Example**: If A > B, follow the "Yes" path; otherwise, follow the "No" path.

- **Arrow (Flow Line)**
    - **Description**: Shows the direction of flow in the process from one step to another.
    - **Example**: Arrows connecting the Start, Process, and Stop steps.
    
- **Connector**
    - **Description**: A small circle or a label used to connect different parts of a flowchart when the chart does not fit on a single page.
    - **Example**: Used when linking a flow from one page to another.
    
- **Loop Limit**
    - **Description**: Defines the start and end of a loop and includes the condition for termination.
    - **Example**: Loop until N = 10.

- **Display**
    - **Description**: Used to represent output data displayed on a screen or monitor.
    - **Example**: Display results of a calculation on the monitor.
    
- **Document**
    - **Description**: Represents data that can be read by humans.
    - **Example**: Printed reports or documents.
      
- **Stored Data (Direct Access)**
    - **Description**: Data stored on a device like a hard drive that can be accessed randomly.
    - **Example**: Storing information on a hard disk.
    
- **Stored Data (Sequential Access)**
    - **Description**: Data stored on devices that require sequential access, such as magnetic tapes.
    - **Example**: Accessing records stored on a tape.
    
- **Preparation/Initialization**
    - **Description**: Indicates initialization of variables or preparation steps that are needed but not explicitly shown as input.
    - **Example**: Initialize A = 0, B = 0.

### **Flowchart Example**

Below is the flowchart for calculating the product of three numbers, with shapes included (Kunware nalang yun yung shapes tinatamad ako ):

```plaintext
+---------------------+
|        Start         |  <-- Oval (Start)
+---------------------+
          |
          ↓
+---------------------+
|   Input A, B, C      |  <-- Parallelogram (Input)
+---------------------+
          |
          ↓
+---------------------+
|    P = A * B * C     |  <-- Rectangle (Process)
+---------------------+
          |
          ↓
+---------------------+
|      Output P        |  <-- Parallelogram (Output)
+---------------------+
          |
          ↓
+---------------------+
|        Stop          |  <-- Oval (Stop)
+---------------------+
```

This flowchart visually represents the steps to calculate the product of three numbers:
- **Start** the process.
- **Input** three numbers (A, B, C).
- **Process** by calculating the product (P = A * B * C).
- **Output** the result (P).
- **Stop** the process.

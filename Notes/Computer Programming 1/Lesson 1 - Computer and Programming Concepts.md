### **Lesson 1: Computer and Programming Concept**

**Computer**  
- An electronic device that accepts, processes, stores, and outputs data.

**Data**  
- Raw, unorganized facts and figures.

**Information**  
- Processed data that is structured and meaningful.

**Hardware**  
- Physical components of a computer (e.g., CPU, keyboard, mouse, monitor).

**Software**  
- Programs or instructions that control hardware and execute tasks.

**System Software**  
- Software that directly interacts with hardware (e.g., operating systems like Windows, Linux).

**Application Software**  
- Programs designed for users to perform specific tasks (e.g., Microsoft Word, Excel).

**Program**  
- A set of instructions for a computer to execute tasks.

**Programming**  
- The process of writing instructions (code) for a computer.

**Steps in Programming**  
- **Define the problem**: Understanding the problem thoroughly.  
- **Design the solution**: Creating algorithms using flowcharts or pseudocode.  
- **Code the program**: Writing the program in a programming language (e.g., C).  
- **Test the program**: Debugging and verifying the program works correctly.  
- **Document the program**: Writing documentation for users and developers.

**Algorithm**  
- A set of step-by-step instructions to solve a problem.

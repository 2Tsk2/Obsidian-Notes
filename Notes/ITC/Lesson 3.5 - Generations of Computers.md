6. **EDVAC (1947)**:
   - Successor to ENIAC, introduced the concept of stored program computers.

7. **Manchester Mark I (1949)**:
   - The first stored-program digital computer, serving as the prototype for the Ferranti Mark I.

8. **EDSAC (1949)**:
   - An early British stored-program computer built by Maurice Wilkes at the University of Cambridge.

### **Transistorized and Mainframe Computers (1950s-1970s)**

1. **UNIVAC (1951)**:
   - First general-purpose computer for commercial use, a successor to the ENIAC.

2. **IBM System/360 (1964)**:
   - A family of mutually compatible computers, marking IBM’s transition from punched-card equipment to electronic computer systems.

3. **CDC 6600 (1964)**:
   - Designed by Seymour Cray, it was the fastest computer in the world at that time.

4. **DEC PDP-8 (1965)**:
   - The first successful minicomputer, widely used in various fields due to its affordability and size.

5. **Apollo Guidance Computer (1968)**:
   - Used in the Apollo missions, particularly for navigation and control during spaceflights.

6. **Interface Message Processor (1969)**:
   - The precursor to the modern router, critical in the development of ARPANET, the forerunner of the Internet.

### **Personal Computers and Microcomputers (1970s-1980s)**
1. **Kenbak-1 (1971)**:
   - Often considered the first "personal computer" but lacked a microprocessor.

2. **Altair 8800 (1975)**:
   - Widely regarded as the first commercially successful personal computer, which led to the development of software languages like BASIC by Bill Gates and Paul Allen.

3. **Apple I (1976)**:
   - A build-it-yourself kit conceived by Steve Wozniak and sold with Steve Jobs' help, paving the way for the success of Apple II.

4. **Apple II (1977)**:
   - An immediate hit with a wide range of applications, pioneering the personal computer market with color graphics.

5. **IBM PC (1981)**:
   - Marked the beginning of the mainstream personal computer market, running on Intel's 8088 microprocessor and using MS-DOS.

### **Supercomputers and Advanced Machines (1970s-Present)**

1. **Cray-1 (1976)**:
   - Designed by Seymour Cray, known for being the fastest computer at its release, prioritizing speed and processing capacity.
